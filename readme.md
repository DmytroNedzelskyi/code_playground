# Code Playground

This repository is a lab that is used for implementing:

- different concepts
- patterns
- algorithms
- challenges
- language basics
- ... etc

using different programming languages.

I find it useful for interview preparation and just to try code something using different languages.

The idea is to have one file for one thing, so it can be run using the [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) extension in VSCode.
